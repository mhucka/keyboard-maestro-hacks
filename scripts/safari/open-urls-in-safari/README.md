# Open all selected URLs in tabs in Safari

I sometimes have a list of URLs saved somewhere, and I want to open them all in Safari. This script does that for me. It tells Safari to open a new window, then opens the URLs as tabs in that window.

I bind this to a keystroke in Keyboard Maestro. The result is that I can select a list of URLs somewhere (e.g., in the note of an item in OmniFocus, or in a Markdown file), hit the keystroke, and all the links will be open in a new Safari window.
